   This essay is an attempt to describe and explain the way that an
   unusual (but by no means anomalous) culture has developed under the
   aegis of PMC-MOO, a text-based virtual-reality program that runs on a
   networked Unix workstation. It is also an attempt to describe the
   scholarly and pedagogical trajectory of this program, by identifying
   the conceptual coordinates of its origin.
   
   MOOs belong to a class of programs known as MUDs, and MUDs are ably
   defined by Pavel Curtis, the inventor of MOOs, as follows:
   
     A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or, sometimes, Multi-User Dimension) is a
     network-accessible, multi-participant, user-extensible virtual
     reality whose user interface is entirely textual. Participants
     (usually called players) have the appearance of being situated in an
     artificially-constructed place that also contains those other
     players who are connected at the same time. Players can communicate
     easily with each other in real time.[4] This virtual gathering place
     has many of the social attributes of other places, and many of the
     usual social mechanisms operate there. Certain attributes of this
     virtual place, however, tend to have significant effects on social
     phenomena, leading to new mechanisms and modes of behavior not
     usually seen `IRL' (in real life).
     
   
   
   I will substantially disagree with that last point in the course of
   this essay, but suffice it to say, for now, that in practical terms,
   the experience of participating in a MOO is that one sits at a
   keyboard, in front of a screen, and projects oneself over a global
   computer network into an entirely textual world, and into an entirely
   virtual community. Community is generally a function of shared
   location, shared interests, and sometimes shared government and shared
   property: in order to deserve the name, a community needs more than
   one, though not necessarily all, of those attributes.
   
   In the case of PMC-MOO, the community which I will discuss here, all
   those attributes are present in some sense or in some measure.
   However, it would be a mistake to see this community, or the larger
   archipelago civilization of MOOs to which it belongs, as entirely
   communitarian, or as entirely self- determining. Rather, I will argue,
   PMC-MOO and MOOs in general take shape under twin forces not unlike
   fate and free will, where free will is what we always have understood
   it to be, but where the role of fate is played by the operating system
   in which the MOO is embedded. The aporia in this analogy, and it is an
   important one for my argument, is that unlike transcendental fate,
   computer operating systems are historically and culturally determined.
   
  Unix and Monopoly Capital:
  
   
   
    To understand the cultural moment that is expressed in the operating
   system in question, Unix, and to understand the effects of Unix on the
   formation of MOO code and MOO culture, we must isolate and understand
   a few concepts and a little history as well. For our purposes, the
   concepts that matter most are expressed in their most basic form in
   the Unix filesystem, as hierarchy, user groups, and ownership. The
   Unix filesystem is hierarchical in its organization, and the
   particular kind of hierarchy is, in essence, dendritic: file systems
   have a tree- like structure, with a "root" directory containing files
   and other directories, or branches, of the filesystem, which in turn
   can contain other files and directories. In Unix, every file (and
   indeed, every process) has an individual owner, and the hierarchy of
   owners explicitly mirrors the hierarchy of the filesystem itself, with
   the superuser of all users and user groups called "root." Every
   individual user, then, belongs to one or more user groups, and the
   permission to read, write, delete, search, or execute a particular
   file is precisely defined for owner, group, and other. It is difficult
   to exaggerate the importance of these basic concepts in Unix: in fact,
   the filesystem organization is itself a kind of first cause for Unix,
   inasmuch as its origins lie in the dim prehistory of Unix, in Multics.
   Multics was a multi-user mainframe operating system developed jointly
   in the late 1960s by Bell Labs, MIT, and General Electric and intended
   to permit time-sharing on large, expensive, centralized computer
   resources. Not surprisingly, the developers of Multics, and after
   them, the developers of Unix, reasoned that if an operating system
   will permit many users to look at and manipulate the same files at the
   same time, it is necessary to establish which users are associated
   with which files, and what permissions are granted them.
   
   AT&T; began developing Multics in 1964,[5] eight years after the 1956
   Consent Decree which settled the last anti-trust suit against the
   company. Although the 1956 decision said nothing about software
   (because the concept wasn't available), AT&T; interpreted the decision
   cautiously, and when Unix came along, the company decided to
   distribute its operating system on non-profit terms-- licensed at very
   low cost to universities, and priced prohibitively high for commercial
   clients, expressly so as to avoid developing a software business. In
   fact, what was distributed was the source code, which meant that
   university researchers could tinker with the system, offer
   improvements, and make modifications to suit their needs. However,
   since Bell Labs was distributing the software at or near cost, it
   wasn't particularly interested in providing user support. This
   fostered two things--a kind of priesthood of the code, manifested as a
   hierarchy of arcane knowledge about the complex and often cryptically
   documented system, and also a self-supporting user community, which
   became incarnate in the late 1970s and early 1980s as Usenet. Usenet
   was (and is) an independent mail network that allowed users to post
   questions and receive answers about specific features of Unix, or
   about applications that run under Unix. Usenet still flourishes, and
   still fulfills its original function, but it has expanded to include
   discussion of many topics that have nothing to do with operating
   systems, and it has become an asynchronous culture in its own
   right.[6]
   
   In the largest context, then, Unix developed as a byproduct of
   research at a corporate laboratory, under the constraints imposed by
   anti-trust legislation, which helped to force it out of the channels
   in which proprietary inventions usually travel in a capitalist
   economy, and into the freely exchanged economy of academic research
   and invention. It should also be noted, though, that Bell Labs itself,
   at least in its research divisions, was and may still be a more
   fertile environment for technological creativity than many
   universities. The nature of pure research is that one doesn't know
   what will ultimately "pay off": therefore, it's necessary to invest in
   a diversified portfolio of research activities. According to Samuel P.
   Morgan, a member of the Bell labs Research Area beginning in 1947 and,
   during the early seventies, Director of the Computing Science Research
   Center,
   
     If there aren't a certain number of things taken up in the
     organization every year that don't work out, we're not being
     sufficiently aggressive, or innovative, or we are not gambling
     enough. . . . We work on percentages, and of course this is true
     throughout any research organization. We've got to have a certain
     number of failures. . . .[7]
     
   
   
   In fact, it is only a very large accumulation of wealth that makes it
   practical to gamble in this way, investing resources in doing research
   with no immediately obvious economic benefit. Moreover, the kind of
   research environment that produces these unpredictable benefits,
   especially in the area of computer hardware and software, has proven
   to be decentralized and voluntaristic. This is true even outside of
   the area of pure research, in the application of computer technology
   to business operations. According to V.M. Wolontis, Executive Director
   of the Operations Research Division at Bell labs during the early days
   of Unix,
   
     Things in the computer applications field have developed because
     individual people at the working level have had ideas and have
     pursued them. Things have grown from the working level up, rather
     than by some major management figure sitting at his desk saying this
     shall be computerized, and bingo, a hundred people march in the
     direction of computerizing a big segment of the operation. There is
     a tendency for the computer as a tool to inject itself into the
     operation through the efforts of interested specialists who enjoy it
     and who want to make the contribution. Management approval is a
     subsequent step.[8]
     
   
   
   Although the kind of intellectual freedom to "play around" with
   problems and "contribute" solutions does depend on the kind of
   corporate security that comes only under the auspices of monopoly
   capital or government, individual projects still have to at least
   attempt to justify themselves with respect to some cost- benefit
   analysis, however putative: even when gambling, there are better and
   worse bets. Within the atmosphere of free invention, the time-sharing
   and resource-coupling nature of the Unix operating system was driven,
   paradoxically, by the prohibitive cost of mainframes, which dictated
   that each machine should have more than one user and, if possible,
   more than one user at a time. One of the original developers of Unix
   recalls that, when their group faced the decline of Multics, their
   requests for new computer equipment on which to write a new operating
   system were repeatedly rebuffed: "[I]t is perfectly obvious in
   retrospect (and should have been at the time) that we were asking the
   Labs to spend too much money on too few people with too vague a
   plan."[9]
   
   The fact that the operating system developed in the context of a
   corporate entity whose primary business was telecommunications, and
   whose primary interests were communications and connectivity, helped
   to enshrine within it the principles of modularity and
   interoperability. But at another level, one extremely relevant to the
   effects that Unix has had in the world, communication was a motivating
   factor in the design of this operating system:
   
     Even though Multics could not then support many users, it could
     support us, albeit at exorbitant cost. We didn't want to lose the
     pleasant niche we occupied, because no similar ones were available;
     even the time-sharing service that would later be offered under GE's
     operating system did not exist. What we wanted to preserve was not
     just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system
     around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that
     the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access,
     time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal
     instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.[10]
     
   
   
   The fact that the software these researchers produced was easy to
   modify, good at accepting instructions from remote users, and
   unsupported by its corporate parent, helped to ensure that one of the
   first uses to which it would be put, once it reached the outside
   world, was the networking of users into a community, originally a
   user-support community, but later something much more diverse.
   
   If we consider all these factors together, the paradoxes are striking.
   On the one hand, as a mental representation of the universe of
   information, Unix is deeply indebted to culturally determined notions
   such as private property, class membership, and hierarchies of power
   and effectivity. Most of these ideas are older than the modern Western
   culture that produced Unix, but the constellation of cultural elements
   gathered together in Unix's basic operating principles seems
   particularly Western and capitalist--not surprisingly, given that its
   creators were human extensions of one of the largest accumulations of
   capital in the Western world. On the other hand, this tool, shaped
   though it was by the notions of ownership and exclusivity, spawned a
   culture of cooperation, of homemade code, of user-contributed
   modifications and improvements (viz. the canonical /contrib/bin in
   Unix filesystems, where user-contributed programs are stored) --in
   short, of "fellowship." And finally, in some sense it is true, as
   Guattari suggests, that the entire assemblage of causes for Unix is an
   instance of machines speaking to machines, or needing to speak to
   machines, with humans as the midwife at this precarious and unlikely
   birth. In order to explicate this paradox, though, it might help us to
   consider a set of relevant insights from an early and expert analyst
   of capitalism, Karl Marx.
   
  MOOs and Marx:
  
   
   
    In writing about the French Revolution, Karl Marx observed that the
   civil [or bourgeois] society that was established for the first time
   by that revolution understands itself to be based on the "natural and
   imprescriptible rights" declared in the Constitution of 1793, namely
   "equality, liberty, security, property." According to that document,
   liberty "consists in the right to do anything which does not harm
   others;" the right of property "is the right vested in every citizen
   to enjoy and dispose of his goods, his revenues, the fruit of his
   labour and of his industry according to his will;" equality "consists
   in the fact that the same law applies to all, whether that law
   protects or punishes;" and security "consists in the protection which
   society offers to each of its members for the preservation of his
   person, his rights, and his property." It is worth pointing out that
   each of these rights has its equivalent in the world of Unix: users,
   the equivalent of citizens, are permitted actions which do not harm
   the data of others--unless those others have, of their own free will,
   disposed of that data so that permission is granted to others to
   overwrite it; the same rights apply to all (within a given user class,
   at least. All bets are off when it comes to root--but even in
   Enlightenment democracies, equality has always been the most
   problematic right, especially when it comes to conflicts of interest
   between an individual and the state. . .and arguably, since all rights
   are granted, ultimately, by root, root is the Unix equivalent of the
   State). Security, in Unix terms, is called exactly the same thing, and
   providing systems security, so as to protect the accumulated labor of
   legitimate users, is considered the paramount duty of the Unix systems
   administrator.[11]
   
   Marx finds these "so-called rights of man" to be the defining
   characteristics of bourgeois society because none of them
   
     goes beyond the egoistic man, beyond man as a member of civil
     society, as man separated from life in the community and withdrawn
     into himself, into his private interest and his private arbitrary
     will. These rights are far from conceiving man as a species-being.
     They see, rather, the life of the species itself, society, as a
     frame external to individuals, as a limitation of their original
     independence. The only bond that keeps men together is natural
     necessity, need and private interest, the preservation of property
     and of their egoistic person.[12]
     
   
   
    Because I am arguing that the MOO draws out and enacts some of the
   contradictions inherent not only in Unix and Unix culture, but also in
   capitalism and Western culture, it is important to stop here and
   concentrate for a moment on the term that Marx opposes to bourgeois
   monadic egotism. Marx defines "species- being" elsewhere, in
   manuscripts written during the same period, in terms that cast an
   interesting light on my earlier assertion that Unix, and in its own
   turn, the MOO, are mental representations of a world:
   
     His creation, in practice, of an objective world, his working upon
     inorganic nature, is the proof that man is a conscious
     species-being, that is a being which is related to the species as
     its own essence or to itself as a species being. To be sure, animals
     also produce. They build themselves nests, dwelling places, as the
     bees, beavers, ants, etc. do. But the animal produces what it needs
     directly for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, while man
     produces universally. It produces under the domination of direct
     physical need while man produces even when he is free from physical
     need and produces truly, indeed, only in freedom from such need. The
     animal produces only itself, while man reproduces the whole of
     nature. . . . It is precisely in his working over of the objective
     world, therefore, that man proves himself to be really a species
     being. This production is his active species-life. In and through
     such production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The
     object of labor, therefore, is the objectification of the
     species-life of man: for man duplicates himself not only
     intellectually, as in consciousness, but also actively, in reality,
     and therefore contemplates himself in a world that he has created.
     
   
   
    Once again, the paradox I have in view is that the material
   conditions and conceptual rubrics out of which Unix developed are the
   epitome of capitalist endeavor, and yet Unix itself was circulated on
   quite anti-capitalist terms, answers fairly well to Marx's description
   of universal production (or production that doesn't answer to an
   immediate need).
   
   The tension between these two concepts--civil [or bourgeois] society
   as incarnated in the French Revolution's "Declaration of the Rights of
   Man," and the "species-being" that (Marx says) these rights ignore--is
   precisely the enabling condition of capitalism:
   
     In so far as alienated labor tears the object of his production away
     from man, therefore, it tears away from him his species-life, his
     actual objectivity as a member of the species and transforms his
     advantage over the animal into the disadvantage that his inorganic
     body, nature, is taken away from him. . . . A direct consequence of
     man's alienation from the product of his labor, from his life
     activity, from his species-being, is the alienation of man from man.
     When man confronts himself, he confronts another man. . . .
     Generally, the proposition that man's species-being is alienated
     from him means that one man is alienated from another, just as each
     of them is alienated from human nature.[13]
     
   
   
    The second level of our paradox is that, when the MOO arises it
   answers, better than Unix or even capitalism itself, to Marx's
   description of alienation: within the MOO, when one confronts oneself,
   one literally confronts the representation of a representation of a
   person--a player, a character, a projection of (alienated)
   personality. And yet, again, the labor that goes into creation in the
   MOO is labor which answers exactly to the call of species-life: it is
   creation in the absence of need, the creation of a supremely useless
   object, an object world, an objectification of life in the world.
   
   This brings me to the second chapter of this history, which begins
   about ten years after the invention of Unix, but still in the
   corporate neighborhood of AT&T;, when Pavel Curtis and others at Xerox
   PARC invented MOOcode. MOOs are not intended to replace Unix in any
   sense, but they do mimic some of the functions of an operating system,
   and they mirror many of the features of Unix. In the MOO, which is
   really just a large database, the world is made up of objects: objects
   always have a particular location within the database and the fictive
   landscape of the MOO, and objects are in turn composed of properties
   and verbs. The universe itself is an object (object #0), as are all
   players. Players own themselves, and they belong to one or more
   classes of players.
   
   The basic classes of MOO-character are player, programmer, and wizard.
   Many refinements and elaborations of that tripartite scheme have been
   implemented, but the basic distinctions remain significant: players
   can move around and communicate, but they cannot build or create
   things; programmers are players who can also create, program, and
   recycle their own objects, and they can bestow owned objects on
   others; wizards are programmers who can also program or recycle other
   programmers' objects and players themselves. To this extent, then, the
   MOO adopts the notion of a "root" user, expressing it more fancifully
   in the term "wizard"-- the superuser of all MOO users. In keeping with
   the dendritic hierarchy of files (and processes) in Unix, the MOO has
   its own (anthropomorphized) hierarchy of parents and children.Every
   object and player inherits the verbs and properties of its parent, and
   commands are always executed along a search path that includes one's
   entire parentage. In the moo, things can be readable, writable, and
   executable by wizards only, by the owner, or by anyone, and the system
   of parentage, in its effect, mimics the functionality of user groups
   --for example, the average player on PMC-MOO belongs to the programmer
   class, which in turn is a child of the basic builder class, which in
   turn is a child of Frand's player class, which in turn is a child of
   the basic player class. Such a player has permission to execute any
   verb associated with any group or class that appears in that family
   tree.
   
   Unix and MOOcode share the following characteristics, then: both
   emerged from large corporate research labs (Bell and Xerox,
   respectively); both are hierarchical, multi-user, time-sharing
   environments for the creation, storage, and retrieval of information;
   both systems are predicated on the notion that every object (or file)
   has both an owner and a location, and perhaps most importantly, both
   Unix and MOO function as command interpreters and as programming
   environments. It is this last thing, more than any other single
   feature, that unites MOOcode with Unix and distinguishes it from other
   forms of gaming and/or virtual-reality environments. The "OO" in MOO
   stands for Object Oriented, and it means that programmers can easily
   have access to the individual building blocks of the MOO, and can use
   the tools within the MOO to alter or add to those building blocks.
   
   The important difference between a MOO and the Unix operating system,
   though, is that while both may be considered to be mental
   representations, or self-representations, of information
   processing--models, if you will, of collective memory, of communal
   libraries, even of collective intelligence-- the MOO is the world it
   models, as well as the model of that world. In other words, if
   capitalism is a first-order model of the way labor and value and power
   circulate in the world, Unix is a second-order simulacrum of the way
   that a particular kind of capital, namely information, works in the
   world, and the MOO--an inhabitable model of Unix --is then a
   third-order simulacrum of the world, in which information is not only
   a representation of labor, and a source of power, and a form of value,
   but is also quite literally the form that the species-being takes,
   "not unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging for what is
   real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit without
   reference or circumference."[13]
   
  PMC-MOO: A Virtual Community
  
   
   
    It's time now to discuss the way in which one such simulacrum has
   actually developed, and to think about the future of MOOs in general.
   PMC-MOO is the MOO with which I am most familiar, since I have been
   (with the help of many others)* running it for the last couple of
   years, and since it has, at various times, taken up a good deal of my
   time. It is not the first MOO I started--the NCSU Virtual Campus has
   that dubious distinction [14]--nor is it the newest (iath-moo, the
   virtual conference center for the Institute for Advanced Technology in
   the Humanities is the most recent), but it has become the largest and
   longest lasting of the MOO experiments with which I've been involved.
   PMC-MOO is an offshoot of the electronic journal Postmodern Culture,
   and it was established to serve two principal functions. First and
   foremost, it was intended to provide a text-based conferencing
   facility for journal-related activities, a kind of real-time
   supplement to PMC-Talk, the listserv-based discussion group that has
   always run alongside the peer-reviewed journal. Second, because the
   object-oriented nature of the MOO made this feasible, it was to
   provide an opportunity for interested users to produce interactive
   programs that would demonstrate or interrogate concepts of relevance
   to the study of postmodernism--object-lessons, if you will. In other
   words, from the outset, PMC-MOO had that Disney schizophrenia that
   characterizes Epcot Center--a conference hall surrounded by a theme
   park, work embedded in play.
   
   For a time, quite a time, it seemed that work might never surface at
   all in this environment, and early visitors to the MOO would have been
   justified in doubting that this would ever develop into an environment
   in which anything useful could ever be done. MOOs are naturally
   somewhat chaotic, since the program allows everyone in a room to speak
   and be heard in sequence, with no possibility of interrupting another
   speaker and with little in the way of etiquette that encourages
   orderly, single-topic, limited-participation conversations. Users who
   have spent some time in MOOs do learn to use some common tools, such
   as the stage-talk feature, to identify the topic to which they are
   speaking or the speaker to whom they are responding, and (more
   importantly) they seem to develop a certain ability to do
   conversational multi-tasking, but the MOO tends to be a noisy place
   when there's anything happening at all.
   
   Beyond the noise factor, there is the issue of identity and
   accountability. Professional life and professional credit depends, to
   a large extent, on being able to identify the sources of intellectual
   contributions, and on attributing borrowed ideas to their originators.
   The MOO, by contrast, encourages the borrowing of code, by making it
   easy to copy objects and verbs (or pieces of objects and verbs that
   seem useful) without attribution. The flip side of attribution is
   accountability: since most MOOs, including PMC-MOO (but not iath-moo)
   allow users to create fictitious names for their players, and since it
   is generally the case that only wizards can locate a player's home
   site, anti-social behavior including theft, harassment, impersonation,
   and even "virtual rape," are common problems in these virtual
   environments. PMC-MOOs most famous episode of anti-social behavior
   came to be described as MOO Terrorism, and is described elsewhere in a
   kind of MOO documentary.[15] After our rocky infancy, though, the
   community has stabilized a good deal, and it has begun to develop some
   of the familiar features of civic life--it has a zoning board, a board
   that reviews requests for quota (the permission to create things),
   regular public events including poetry slams and other performance
   events, social hours, and special seminars and events. It also has
   spawned a number of internal discussion groups on various topics, some
   of them theoretical, some of them social, some organizational. It is
   worth noting that, although postmodernism is steeped in the kind of
   theory that even educated non- specialists find difficult to
   penetrate, PMC-MOO has succeeded in drawing a broad range of
   non-specialists into the discussion of theoretical issues, and those
   non-specialists have frequently challenged and in other ways affected
   the conversation on those issues. High school students, college
   students, graduate students, professors, librarians, as well as
   non-academics, government workers, professionals: the population of
   PMC-MOO is diverse, if not by comparison to the general public,
   certainly by comparison to the usual audience for literary and
   critical theory. Furthermore, people whose background was
   non-technical have become interested in programming through the
   experience of inhabiting a shared programming environment, and
   especially (I think) as a result of being able to see and immediately
   share the results of their efforts from within the same environment in
   which they are produced. Some programming that demonstrates postmodern
   theoretical concepts has, in fact, been done, and efforts are underway
   to foreground that programming in the landscape of the MOO.
   
   What this factual history suggests is that, like its parent, Unix, the
   MOO has the capacity to turn play into something useful (though it
   isn't always easy to predict what kinds of play will prove useful, or
   in what ways), and it certainly fulfills the desire of the early Unix
   developers for a communal programming environment in which fellowship
   could come about. The MOO is also clearly an environment in which,
   independent of need, one can pursue creative activities with tangible,
   communal, and perhaps even economic results.[16] As with pure research
   at Bell labs, it seems clear that in the MOO innovation comes from the
   ground up: in fact, the same thing could be said of the internet
   itself--that it was born from a monopoly (in this case, the military),
   and that due to certain external constraints (the threat of nuclear
   war, which dictated its decentralized design) it has developed into a
   chaotic, voluntarist, and unpredictably fertile world in which
   individuals invest large amounts of time and energy "playing" in ways
   that sometimes produce enormously useful innovations. As far as
   teaching and research go, the MOO (and the same could be said of the
   internet itself) is demonstrably useful for some kinds of pedagogical
   and conferencing purposes, particularly those which rely heavily on
   verbal information (as opposed to graphics or sound), and particularly
   when the community of users has developed a set of consensual rules of
   behavior that downplay the potential for communicational chaos and
   anti-social behavior, and that play up the potential for cooperation
   and collaboration.
   
   In closing, I'd like to recall for a moment a recent advertising
   campaign for AT&T;, in which lots of "ordinary" (but very
   professional-looking) people are shown using technology in futuristic
   ways. The tag-line of the campaign is "have you ever ... You will":
   "Have you ever gone to a meeting in your bathrobe?" asks the
   voice-over, while a man lounges at the breakfast table while
   video-conferencing, "Or sent a fax from the beach?" while the man
   lounges in his beach-chair, sending a fax from his (apparently
   sand-proof) laptop: "You will." I'm sure that AT&T; intends this
   campaign to present a happy vision of the future, in which work
   somehow is less work-like; I'm equally certain, though, that it's
   possible to view the campaign in exactly the opposite light, to hear
   an imperative tone in that "You Will," and to consider that, without
   that handy laptop, the man on the beach might not have to be working.
   It is, in some sense, the essence of professional occupation that it
   crosses the line into our personal lives: no profession is truly 9-5.
   If technology, born from useful play, becomes an environment in which
   work can be carried on in the guise of play, then either we will never
   really work, or we will never really play, after this. It remains to
   be seen which of these--or both, or neither--proves to be the case.

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology, for example, in
       June of 1994 issued a call for proposals on the use of MUDs for
       manufacturing--a virtual shop floor, if you will. This brings my
       argument full circle, and perhaps raises the specter of virtual
       Taylorism... Back
