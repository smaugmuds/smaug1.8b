	mob_prog Autoquesting Snippet v1.0
	for Smaug 1.4a
	Author: Mike Counts aka GenmaC (frag16@yahoo.com)

	You can give me credit for this if you like, but it's such an obvious and
	simple snippet that I don't require it.  I would be very interested, should
	you use it, in the way you implemented it, so drop me a note and I'll come
	play your MUD ;p

	I wrote this snippet, because, even the "fixed" versions of the old autoquesting
	system sucked, to be honest, and are buggy as hell, and aren't very flexible at all.

	This system sets up a quest file for each player, so you can do all the checking
	and setting yourself, thru the mud_progs.

	Thanks to Koryon for pointing out my glaring mistakes on topmudsites.com.

	Thanks to the SMAUG coding team, the Merc coding team, and Diku coding team.

	This bit of code is not released under any sort of license - the code is a port
	from my original game code, so this is not public domain, nor under the GPL.
	However, use it freely, and if you host this snippet on your site, let me know.

First, in smaug/, create a new directory called quests, then make the following changes to
the smaug source (btw, the "new quest" comments are there so you can easily locate the
code with grep or Find in Files).

- mud.h -

on or around line 4241, add:
DECLARE_DO_FUN( do_mpquestcomplete ); // new quest shit

- mud_prog.c -

on or around line 123, add:

/*
	new quest shizat
*/

#define DT_QUEST_DIR "../quests/"

void MarkQuestComplete(char *quest, CHAR_DATA *player);
bool CheckQuestComplete(char *quest, CHAR_DATA *player);

/*
	MarkQuestComplete
	Appends the line passed to it to the player's quest file.
	Note that it could duplicate quests if marked more than once,
	so use if questcomplete before calling this.
*/
void MarkQuestComplete(char *quest, CHAR_DATA *player)
{
	char quest_file[100];
	FILE * fw;

	strcpy(quest_file, DT_QUEST_DIR);
	strcat(quest_file, player->name);
	strcat(quest_file, ".qdt");
	
	fw = NULL;
	fw = fopen(quest_file,"a");

	fprintf(fw, "%s\n",quest);
	printf("stuck %s in %s - correct?\n",quest,quest_file);
	fclose(fw);
}

/*
	CheckQuestComplete

	finds the quest entry in /quests/player_name.qdt, and returns 1 if
	found.
*/
bool CheckQuestComplete(char *quest, CHAR_DATA *player)
{
	char quest_file[100];
	char read_string[100];
	bool bFound;
	FILE * read;

	strcpy(quest_file, DT_QUEST_DIR);
	strcat(quest_file, player->name);
	strcat(quest_file, ".qdt");

	read = fopen(quest_file, "r");

	bFound = 0;

	if(read==NULL)
	{
	return FALSE;
	}
	while(fgets(read_string,99,read) != NULL)
	{
		if(read_string[strlen(read_string)-1] == '\n')
		{
			read_string[strlen(read_string)-1]='\0';
		}

		if( !str_cmp(quest,read_string) )
		{
			bFound = 1;
			break;
		}
	}
	return bFound;
}


on or around line 853, add with the other ifcheck statements:
	if( !str_cmp(chck, "questcomplete" ) /* new quest shizat */
	{ /* usage: if questcomplete($n) == QuestName */
		return(CheckQuestComplete(rval,chkchar));
	}

At the end of mob_prog.c, add:

// new quest shizat

void do_mpquestcomplete( CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument )
{
    char       arg[ MAX_INPUT_LENGTH ];
    CHAR_DATA *victim;
 
    if ( !IS_NPC( ch ) || IS_AFFECTED( ch, AFF_CHARM ))
    {
          send_to_char( "Huh?\n\r", ch );
          return;
    }
 
    argument = one_argument( argument, arg );
 
    if ( arg[0] == '\0' )
    {
	progbug( "Mpquestcomplete - No argument", ch );
	return;
    }
 
    if ( !( victim = get_char_room( ch, arg ) ) )
    {
	progbug( "Mpquestcomplete - victim does not exist", ch );
	return;
    }

	if( IS_NPC(victim) )
	{
		send_to_char("Mobs can't have quests!\n\r",ch);
		return;
	}

    if ( argument[0] == '\0' )
	{
		progbug( "Mpquestcomplete - no quest to complete",ch);
		return;
	}

	if(argument[strlen(argument)-1] == '\0')
	{
		argument[strlen(argument)-1] = '\0';
	}

	MarkQuestComplete(argument, victim);

}

tables.c

on or around line 461, add:
	if(  !str_cmp( name, "do_mpquestcomplete" )) return do_mpquestcomplete; // new quest shit
on or around line 1115, add:
	if ( skill == do_mpquestcomplete ) return "do_mpquestcomplete"; // new quest shit

commands.dat:

Add mpquestcomplete to the commands.dat file, just copy do_mpforce, and change it to
name: mpquestcomplete, and code: do_mpquestcomplete.

Here's an example prog:

if questcomplete($n) == TestQuest
say You've completed TestQuest!
else
say You haven't completed TestQuest yet!
mpquestcomplete $n TestQuest
say And now you have!
endif

The questcomplete if check is a little wierd.  The operator doesn't matter, so you could
use if questcomplete(whoever) >, <, or ==, and it would always return the same result:
TRUE if the right value (the quest name, on the right of the operator) has been completed, 
or FALSE if whoever has not completed the quest. (even if you use !=, the return is the same -
this does not take into account the operator at all!)

Note also that this is a semi-efficient way to do global variables, with an on or off setting,
the only problem being that there's not yet a way to turn the variables off (I'll code that up
for revision 1.5 of this snippet).

What do I mean by this...say you have a thief guild of NPCs, and you want them to hate
anyone who's ever killed on of their members...you could add this to their death_prog:

if questcomplete($n) == HasKilledAThief  	<-- they have killed a thief
shout Thieve's Guild, to my aid!		<-- so scream for help
else						<-- they haven't killed a thief
mpquestcomplete $n HasKilledAThief		<-- so mark them as a killer
say You shall pay!
endif

Then, add an entry prog/greet prog something like this:

if questcomplete($n) == HasKilledAThief		<-- they have killed a thief
say Kill the offender!
mpkill $n					<-- so attack them
else						<-- otherwise
say Well, hello, $n.				<-- a friendly greeting
endif

Have fun.
